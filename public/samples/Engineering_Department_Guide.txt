- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch
- Cloud: AWS (primary), GCP (ML workloads)
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker
- Monitoring: Datadog, PagerDuty, Sentry

2.2 Git Workflow
We follow a trunk-based development model:
- Main branch: `main` (always deployable)
- Feature branches: `feature/JIRA-123-short-description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/JIRA-456-short-description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/JIRA-789-short-description`

Branch Rules:
- All changes require a pull request
- PRs require at least 2 approving reviews
- CI must pass before merging
- Squash merge is the default merge strategy
- Branches are deleted after merge

2.3 Code Review Standards
Every PR must be reviewed with attention to:
- Correctness: Does it solve the problem?
- Security: Are there any vulnerabilities?
- Performance: Are there any performance concerns?
- Readability: Is the code clean and well-documented?
- Testing: Are there adequate tests?
- Design: Does it follow our architecture patterns?

Review SLAs:
- Critical/Hotfix PRs: Review within 2 hours
- Standard PRs: Review within 1 business day
- Large PRs (>500 lines): Review within 2 business days

2.4 Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage minimum: 80%
- Integration tests required for all API endpoints
- E2E tests required for critical user flows
- Performance tests required for any database query changes
- Security tests required for authentication/authorization changes

Testing Tools:
- Unit Tests: Jest (JS/TS), pytest (Python), go test (Go)
- Integration Tests: Supertest, pytest-asyncio
- E2E Tests: Playwright
- Performance: k6, Artillery
- Security: Snyk, OWASP ZAP

SECTION 3: DEPLOYMENT AND RELEASE

3.1 Deployment Pipeline
1. Developer pushes to feature branch
2. CI runs: lint, type-check, unit tests, integration tests
3. PR reviewed and approved
4. Merged to main
5. CI runs full test suite on main
6. Automatic deployment to staging
7. Smoke tests run on staging
8. Manual approval for production deployment
9. Canary deployment (10% traffic for 30 minutes)
10. Full rollout if metrics are healthy

3.2 Release Schedule
- Regular releases: Every Tuesday and Thursday at 10:00 AM PT
- Hotfix releases: As needed, any time
- Feature flag releases: Can be toggled independently of deployments
- Freeze periods: No deployments during major holidays or company events

3.3 Rollback Procedures
If a deployment causes issues:
1. Trigger rollback via PagerDuty or deployment dashboard
2. Rollback completes within 5 minutes
3. Post-rollback: Create incident ticket in Jira
4. Root cause analysis required within 24 hours
5. Post-mortem document due within 48 hours

3.4 Feature Flags
We use LaunchDarkly for feature flag management:
- All new features must be behind a feature flag
- Flags should have clear naming: `enable-feature-name`
- Remove flags within 30 days of full rollout
- Flag ownership must be assigned in LaunchDarkly

SECTION 4: ON-CALL AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

4.1 On-Call Rotation
- Each team maintains a weekly on-call rotation
- On-call engineer must respond to pages within 15 minutes
- Secondary on-call serves as backup
- On-call shifts: Monday 9 AM to following Monday 9 AM PT
- On-call compensation: $500/week flat rate + $100/incident outside business hours

4.2 Incident Severity Levels

SEV-1 (Critical):
- Complete service outage or data breach
- Response time: 15 minutes
- All hands until resolved
- Executive notification required
- Example: Main API completely down, customer data exposed

SEV-2 (High):
- Major feature degradation affecting >10% of users
- Response time: 30 minutes
- On-call team + relevant experts
- Example: Search functionality broken, payment processing slow

SEV-3 (Medium):
- Minor feature degradation affecting <10% of users
- Response time: 2 hours
- On-call engineer investigates
- Example: Report generation delayed, non-critical API errors

SEV-4 (Low):
- Cosmetic issues or minor bugs
- Response time: Next business day
- Tracked in Jira, fixed in normal sprint cycle
- Example: UI alignment issue, non-impactful log errors

4.3 Post-Mortem Process
After any SEV-1 or SEV-2 incident:
1. Incident lead writes post-mortem within 48 hours
2. Document includes: timeline, root cause, impact, resolution, action items
3. Post-mortem reviewed in weekly engineering all-hands
4. Action items tracked in Jira with owners and deadlines
5. No blame culture - focus on systemic improvements

SECTION 5: ENGINEERING BENEFITS AND PERKS

5.1 Professional Development
- Annual learning budget: $3,000 per engineer (exceeds company standard of $2,000)
- Conference attendance: Up to 2 conferences per year
- Internal tech talks: Every Friday 3-4 PM
- Book club: Monthly engineering book club with provided copies
- Certification reimbursement: 100% for relevant certifications

5.2 Equipment
Standard engineer setup includes:
- MacBook Pro 16" (M3 Pro, 36GB RAM, 1TB SSD) or equivalent Linux laptop
- 2x 32" 4K monitors
- Mechanical keyboard (choice of brand, up to $200)
- Ergonomic chair (Herman Miller Aeron or equivalent)
- Standing desk

Hardware refresh cycle: Every 3 years or upon approval for role changes.

5.3 PTO Carryover (Engineering-Specific)
Engineering team members may carry over up to 10 unused PTO days into the following year, exceeding the company standard of 5 days. This was approved by the VP of Engineering to account for on-call commitments and release freeze periods.

5.4 Flexible Hours
Engineers have flexible working hours with no fixed core hours requirement (overriding the company standard of 10 AM - 3 PM core hours). The only requirement is:
- Attend your team's daily standup
- Be available for scheduled meetings
- Meet sprint commitments
- Respond to on-call pages within SLA

SECTION 6: ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS

6.1 Microservices Guidelines
- Each service should have a single responsibility
- Services communicate via REST APIs or gRPC
- Event-driven communication via Kafka for async workflows
- Each service owns its data and database
- Service mesh (Istio) handles inter-service communication

6.2 API Standards
- RESTful APIs follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- All APIs must be versioned: `/api/v1/resource`
- Pagination required for list endpoints (cursor-based preferred)
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Request/response logging for debugging
- Error responses follow RFC 7807 (Problem Details)

6.3 Database Guidelines
- PostgreSQL for relational data (default choice)
- Redis for caching and session storage
- MongoDB for document storage (content, logs)
- Elasticsearch for search functionality
- All databases must have automated backups
- Schema migrations managed via versioned migration files
- No raw SQL in application code - use ORM/query builders

6.4 Security Standards
- All endpoints require authentication (except health checks)
- Use JWT tokens with 1-hour expiration
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- All external communications over TLS 1.3
- Input validation on all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS prevention via output encoding
- CSRF protection on all state-changing endpoints

SECTION 7: DOCUMENTATION

7.1 Documentation Requirements
All engineers must maintain:
- README.md in every repository
- API documentation (auto-generated from OpenAPI specs)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant decisions
- Runbooks for operational procedures
- Onboarding guides for each team

7.2 Documentation Tools
- Confluence: Long-form documentation, ADRs, runbooks
- GitHub Wiki: Repository-specific docs
- Swagger/OpenAPI: API documentation
- Notion: Meeting notes and project planning
- Loom: Video walkthroughs for complex features

---

SECTION 8: SPRINT AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT

8.1 Sprint Cadence
- Sprint length: 2 weeks
- Sprint planning: Monday 10 AM PT (first day of sprint)
- Daily standup: 9:30 AM PT (15 minutes max)
- Sprint review/demo: Friday 2 PM PT (last day of sprint)
- Retrospective: Friday 3 PM PT (last day of sprint)

8.2 Estimation
We use story points with Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13):
- 1 point: Trivial change, <1 hour
- 2 points: Small change, half day
- 3 points: Medium change, 1-2 days
- 5 points: Large change, 3-4 days
- 8 points: Very large, full sprint
- 13 points: Should be broken down into smaller stories

8.3 Definition of Done
A story is "done" when:
- Code is written and peer-reviewed
- Unit and integration tests pass
- Documentation is updated
- Feature flag is configured
- Deployed to staging and verified
- Product owner has accepted the work
